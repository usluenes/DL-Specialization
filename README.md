# Deep Learning Specialization
Deep Learning Specialization Tasks

## Introduction

## What I Want To Say
Here I release the projects I have completed through out the specialization courses which are **only for your reference purpose**. It may help you to save time.  You will notice if you read the instructions carefully, the programming assignments are fairly easy.
